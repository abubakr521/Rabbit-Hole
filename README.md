Due to limited information on zero trust networks I am focusing on other types of networks so that their findings can be implemented on ZTN with some limitations due to

Similarities
Malicious intent remains the same regardless of the type of internet
Common threat types are seen in various networks

Differences
Zero trust model eliminates trust within network so the absence of pre-established trust needs to be adjusted
There needs to be constant verification of devices and requests in ZTN so techniques used in other networks might not map properly
ZTNâ€™s are very dynamic and scalable as compared to other networks so the detection methods also need to be scalable and efficient as they grow

How to use information from other networks 
Anomaly detection techniques can be adapted
Threat intelligence from other networks can be leveraged
Best practices can be applied

Challenges
ZTN requires granular access control policies(wo can have access to what part of system and what they can do with that access) as compared to other networks so existing solutions might need modification
Techniques from other networks might need to enhance performance due to continuous monitoring because of continuous verification
