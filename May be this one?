This information can come from various sources like social media, news websites, government databases, and public records.

Ethical uses of OSINT are vast. Businesses can use it for competitor research and market analysis. Journalists can leverage it for investigative reporting. Law enforcement agencies can utilize OSINT for criminal investigations and threat detection.
