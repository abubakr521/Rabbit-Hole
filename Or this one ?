- **Session 1: ICS Basics**
    
    **IT:** Information Technology refers to computing technology
    
    **OT:** Operating Technology refers to systems for monitoring events, processes, devices, and for making adjustments in industrial operations
    
    - **Common ICS Systems include SCADA, DCS, PCS, EMS, AS, SIS:**
        
        **SCADA:** Supervisory Control And Data Acquisitions
        
        **DCS:** Distributed Control Systems support process industries such as refineries, chemical plants. HMI softwares are integrated with DCSs
        
        **PCS:** Process Control Systems has computers, PC equipments, comm networks for maintaining output of specific functions. AKA hybrid between SCADA and DCS. Communicate with filed controllers.
        
        **EMS:** Energy Maintaining Systems manage data and info to maintain and improve energy performance efficiently. Generation and distribution of energy across grid, load forecasting, load shedding, weather, economic generation, renewable energy integration, automatic generation control, network modelling, electric power system state estimation, contingency planning.
        
        **AS:** Automation System used in warehouse, inventory controls, HVAC, smart home, robots, lighting. Are cheap and stand alone
        
        **SIS:** Safety Instrumented System specific for personnel, equipment, environment safety by managing emergency events
        
    - **ICS Architecture:** **Network devices:**
        
        (Purdue model and  3 layer architecture model are more detailed)
        Historian(store history for better decision making)
        Application servers(used in command and control)
        DB servers
        FEP: Front-end Processor
        *(DB and FEP interact with operational data and are related to SCADA)*
        HMI Human Machine Interface(GUI, controlling software)
        Field controllers(interact with field devices and HMI, include RTU(Remote Terminal Unit), PLC(replacement of relays, switches), PAC(Programmable Automation Controller: mix of PLC, RTU,DCS), IED(Intelligent Electric Devices: Control circuits, breakers, voltage))
        Field devices(responsible for moving parts such as sensors, motors, taps(discrete, analog and digital devices))
        safety systems(System Instrumented Functions)
        
    - **Common ICS Cyber Vulnerabilities**
        
        plain text traffic
        open protocols
        prone to DOS
        buffer overflows( old systems(legacy, unpatched))

    - **Causes**
        
        Legacy control systems
        Migration to IT
        Connectivity and network architecture
        Cybersecurity culture absence
        
    - **Q & A session Takeaways**
        
        Showdan is a search engine that has all data on vulnerabilities and exploits regarding ICS.
        
        Make sure your devices are not detectible on showdan
        
        risk assessment vs maturity assessment 
        
    
    ***(The Q/ A session pdf file is attached above in the materials heading)***
    
- **Session 2: ICS Communications**
    - **Communication flow in OT**
        
        Collect from field devices → sent to field controllers(process data sent digital to electric signal and vice versa) → sent to operator via HMI, servers for calculation and storing
        
        
    - **Data flow in OT**
        
        
    - **Common Protocols in ICS**
        
        They are not secure, they are wrapped in TCP/ IP packets and they are prone to MITM
        
        ICCP(Inter-Control Center Protocol)
        aka TASE 2, IEC60870
        used within electrical sector between control centers over port 102
         data source is mapped at client and server
        has secure version
        
        Modbus
        Initially created for serial connections over TCP
        uses port 502
        similar to DNP
        
        OPC
        It is a standard, based on COM(Common Object Model) and Distributed COM
        Includes data access and alarm & events
        have different versions:
        classic OPC
        OPC .NET 4.0
        OPC UA(Unified Architecture). OPC UA platform independent SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) and is secure
        It does not have a port so firewall had to be opened for it which was mitigated in OPC UA
        OPC provides a single framework/ interface for communication between protocols
        
        DNP 3.0(Distributed Network Protocol) 
        Specific for electrical industry
        Send request
        Accept response
        confirmation

        DNP 3 secure authentication
        Emerging open architecture standard over port 20000
        
    - **Questions to be asked to vendor**
        
        Are input validation errors such as buffer overflows, OS and SQL injections being removed
        Are code quality issues, security reviews addressed
        Are there any hard coded passwords used
        Are servers being run as servers or process
        Are latest third party, OS patches being updated
        Are OPC servers being hardened
        
    - **Common Vulnerabilities**
        
        Loss of View: inaccurate decisions due incorrect information read 
        DOS unavailable resources

- **Session 3: Cybersecurity differences between IT and ICS Domains**
    
    ICS refers to any system that gathers information on an industrial process and modifies, regulates, or manages the process to achieve  desired result. It includes SCADA, DCS, PCS, EMS, AS, SIS, and any other automated control system. IT includes Industrial IOT (IIOT) devices.
    
    IT refers to computing technology. It includes IOT devices. 
    
    In ICS different networks are connected and are made secure. There were inherent vulnerabilities because of the perception that these devices are under the use of trusted operators.
    
    IT security focuses in insiders and outsiders while traditional ICS security focuses in the authorized insider
    
    The key differences are in 
    Communications
    Operations
    Support
    
    - **Differences in Communication**
        
        Determinism: Responding to specific time and loop to meet the demands of the process
        Host Applications(Focus): Performing specific set of things
        Internet Access(Focus): Access to be more open or not to the rest of the internet
        Point to Point traffic(definition): Traffic routes/ data flows are defined
        
        
    - **Differences in Operations**
        
        Security and Compliance
        Secure System Development
        Physical Security
        Change management
        
        
    - **Differences in Support**
        
        Antivirus 
        Patch Management 
        People: Environment (Office or Operation) 
        Incident Response and Forensics 
        Asset Classification: Assets involves in an environment 
        Cybersecurity Testing and Audit (methods)
        Technology support Lifetime (sourcing)
        
        
        
    - **Root causes of ICS Cyber Vulnerabilities**
        
        Legacy control systems 
        Most ICS systems are dated if it ain’t broke don’t fix it 
        Migration to IT leads to platform and network vulnerabilities
        Connectivity and network architecture 
        Cybersecurity culture
        
    - **Common ICS Cyber Vulnerabilities**
        
        Plain text traffic
        Open protocols
        Prone to DOS
        Buffer overflows( old systems(stack and heap)
        Weak passwords
        Absence of embedded countermeasures
        Dependent on underlying OS
        Advance features are not secure
        Current IT countermeasures are not useful in OT/ ICS
        Trusted access
        Software vulnerabilities
        Firmware and protocol vulnerabilities
        
- **Session 4: Cyber risks to ICS**
    - **Risk curve**
        
        
    - **Threat trends for ICS**
        
        
    - **Adversarial risk**
        
        It is always big when critical infrastructures are in question because of state interests in such infrastructures
        
        Adversarial tools and techniques
        
        
    - **OSINT Risks**
        
        Collecting data from publicly available information on internet
        
        Use if sites such as FCC or [antennasearch.com](http://antennasearch.com)
        
    - **OPSEC Risks**
        
        Identify critical information
        Analyze threats and vulnerabilities
        Assess risks
        Apply countermeasures
        
        It must be integrated throughout the organization
        
        It also includes physical OPSEC

    - **Merging of IT and ICS**
        
        Use of new operating systems, network applications, and remote access
        
        IT staff introduce new components but also need to understand the needs of operations before applying measures
